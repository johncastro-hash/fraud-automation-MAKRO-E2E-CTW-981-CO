The first step is to locate and click the thumbnail corresponding to 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.
Looking at the current screen, I see "Task Responses" and below that "[88461764] - Captura una foto de 'fachada'". This is NOT the one I need. I need to scroll down to find the 'comprobante' thumbnail.

Now I can see three thumbnails below the main image viewer (around y=415, x=370, 420, 470).
The task requires clicking the thumbnail for 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.
Looking at the "Live Tracking" table below, the `nameString` "COMPROBANTE" corresponds to `foto_foto` 88461765 and `captura_foto` 88461765. I need to find which thumbnail image relates to 'comprobante'.
The thumbnails are small, but the middle one (y=415, x=420) and the right one (y=415, x=470) look like receipts/comprobantes. The first one (y=415, x=370) looks like the 'fachada' we saw before. I will try clicking the middle 
thumbnail first, as it's more clearly a document.

Step 2: Inspect the evidence. I need to find 'Numero pedido' or similar. I see "Factura Electronica de Venta No. 08FT-129663782" near the top of the image (y=120, x=440). I don't see "Numero pedido" explicitly. Maybe "08FT-129663782" is the number I'm looking for. It's quite long. I need to zoom out to see if there's more context or another number elsewhere. I will click the zoom out ('-') button (y=336, x=619).

at 619) didn't seem to change the zoom level much, if at all. The image looks the same size. I will try clicking the '-' button (y=336, x=619) again, aiming more for the center. I still need to see more of the receipt or find 
"Numero pedido".

I can see "Factura Electronica de Venta No. 08FT-129663782" clearly at the top (y=120, x=440). I don't see any other obvious "Numero pedido" or order number. I will assume "08FT-129663782" is the number I need to look for, although it's longer than 10 characters.

Step 3: Value Extraction. I need to look at the "Live Tracking" table, find the row 'N├ÜMERO' and the column 'captura'.
In the table (around y=750-800), the row 'N├ÜMERO' is the first data row (y=799). The 'captura' column (x=680) contains the value '83UZWOALD2' for the 'N├ÜMERO' row.
So, [RAW_VALUE] = '83UZWOALD2'.

Step 4: Data Cleaning. [RAW_VALUE] = '83UZWOALD2'.
A. Remove double-hyphen suffix: '83UZWOALD2' does not have '--'.
B. Remove single-hyphen prefix: '83UZWOALD2' does not have 'L-'.
So, [CLEANED_VALUE] = '83UZWOALD2'. This is exactly 10 characters.

Step 5: Validation Audit. I need to look for '83UZWOALD2' within the image, specifically near "Numero pedido" or similar. I am looking at the main image and I see "Factura Electronica de Venta No. 08FT-129663782" and other numbers, but I do NOT see '83UZWOALD2' anywhere in the currently visible part of the image. I will scroll down the main page to ensure I haven't missed part of the image viewer or another section.

--- Task 1 Audit Result ---
Validation Status: Okay, scrolling back up brought the image into view again.
Now, looking at the image (around y=560, x=360), I see "Número pedido: L-83UZWOALD2".
My [CLEANED_VALUE] was '83UZWOALD2'.
The value in the image is "L-83UZWOALD2". If I apply cleaning rule B (Remove any single-hyphen prefix and everything that precedes it) to "L-83UZWOALD2", I get "83UZWOALD2".

So, the [CLEANED_VALUE] '83UZWOALD2' *is* found in the evidence image after cleaning the prefix from the image text.

Step 6: Final Output. [CLEANED_VALUE] '83UZWOALD2' is found.

The thumbnails are located around (y=413, x=418). The task is to click the one corresponding to 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'. Looking at the "Live Tracking" table, the row 'COMPROBANTE' (y=860, x=190) seems to correspond to this. The thumbnails are small, and I see three of them (y=413, x=369), (y=413, x=418), (y=413, x=470). The first is the 'fachada', the second and third look like documents. I will click the second one (middle) as it's more likely to be the 'comprobante'.

--- Task 2 Audit Result ---
Validation Status: I have evaluated step 1. I clicked the middle thumbnail, and the main image has changed to what looks like a receipt or 'comprobante'. This is correct.

Now for step 2: Evidence Inspection. I need to check if 'Numero pedido' is visible. Looking at the top left of the main image (y=10, x=350), I can see "Número Pedido: L-83V3H68RLW". It is visible and legible. I don't need to zoom or pan for now.

Step 3: Value Extraction. I need to find the value in the "Live Tracking" table at the intersection of row 'NÚMERO' and column 'captura'.
The 'NÚMERO' row is the first data row in the table (y=802, x=190). The 'captura' column is towards the right (y=802, x=688). The value in that cell is '83V3H68RLW--1'.
So, [RAW_VALUE] = '83V3H68RLW--1'.

Step 4: Data Cleaning & Normalization.
[RAW_VALUE] = '83V3H68RLW--1'
A. Remove double-hyphen suffix: '83V3H68RLW--1' becomes '83V3H68RLW'.
B. Remove single-hyphen prefix: There is no single-hyphen prefix in '83V3H68RLW'.
So, [CLEANED_VALUE] = '83V3H68RLW'. It is a 10-character alphanumeric string.

Step 5: Validation Audit. I need to look for [CLEANED_VALUE] ('83V3H68RLW') in the main evidence image, specifically near "Numero pedido".
In the image (top left), I see "Número Pedido: L-83V3H68RLW".
The [CLEANED_VALUE] '83V3H68RLW' IS present within "L-83V3H68RLW".

Step 6: Final Output. Since the [CLEANED_VALUE] '83V3H68RLW' was found within "L-83V3H68RLW" in the image, the output should be "[CLEANED_VALUE] value found".

83V3H68RLW value found

The first step is to find and click the thumbnail corresponding to 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.
Looking at the screen, I see a section "Task Responses" and below it, "[88467445] - Captura una foto de 'fachada'". This is NOT the one I'm looking for. I need to find 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.

I need to scroll down to find the correct thumbnail and the "Live Tracking" data table section.

Now I can see the thumbnails (around y=413) and the "Live Tracking" table below it.
The thumbnails are small images below the main viewer. I need to find the one associated with 'comprobante'.
In the "Live Tracking" table, under the "nameString" column, I see "N├ÜMERO", "FACHADA", "COMPROBANTE", "DOCUMENTO".
The "COMPROBANTE" row has "foto_foto" 88467446 and "captura_foto" 88467446.
This suggests the middle thumbnail (y=413, x=423) or the rightmost one (y=413, x=470) might be the 'comprobante' because "FACHADA" has 88467445 and the first thumbnail was the facade. So, 88467446 is likely the 'comprobante'. 
The middle thumbnail (413, 423) and right (413, 470) look very similar. I will click the middle one, corresponding to 88467446.

2.  **Evidence Inspection:** I need to see if "Numero pedido" or similar is visible. The image is quite large and detailed. I can see some numbers, but I need to look for "Numero pedido". I might need to zoom out or pan. I'll 
first try zooming out to see more of the receipt at once. I see the zoom out button '-' at (y=336, x=619).

--- Task 3 Audit Result ---
Validation Status: I have evaluated step 8. I dragged/scrolled the image up.
YES! Now I can clearly see "Información pedido" and below it:
"Numero pedido: L-83UJ0RZBPR"
This is what I was looking for.

3.  **Value Extraction:** Now I go to the "Live Tracking" table below. I need the row 'NÚMERO' and column 'captura'.
    The row 'NÚMERO' is the first data row in the table (y=801). The 'captura' column is the 6th column (y=801, x=650-690).
    The value in that cell (y=801, x approx 670) is '83UJ0RZBPR'.
    So, [RAW_VALUE] = '83UJ0RZBPR'.

4.  **Data Cleaning & Normalization:**
    [RAW_VALUE] = '83UJ0RZBPR'
    A. Remove double-hyphen suffix: Not present.
    B. Remove single-hyphen prefix: Not present.
    So, [CLEANED_VALUE] = '83UJ0RZBPR'. It is a 10-character alphanumeric string.

5.  **Validation Audit:** I look at the image again. I found "Numero pedido: L-83UJ0RZBPR".
    The value I see in the image after "Numero pedido: " is "L-83UJ0RZBPR".
    My [CLEANED_VALUE] is '83UJ0RZBPR'.
    The value in the image has a prefix "L-". My cleaning rules say remove a *single*-hyphen *prefix* and everything *before* it.

    Let me re-read rule 4B: "Remove any single-hyphen prefix and everything that precedes it (e.g., 'L-83V1EAXU76' becomes '83V1EAXU76')."
    Okay, so if the image has "L-83UJ0RZBPR", the part *after* "L-" is "83UJ0RZBPR".
    My [CLEANED_VALUE] from the table was '83UJ0RZBPR' (it had no prefix in the table).

    The question is: is the [CLEANED_VALUE] ('83UJ0RZBPR') found in the evidence image?
    The image shows "Numero pedido: L-83UJ0RZBPR". Yes, '83UJ0RZBPR' is present within "L-83UJ0RZBPR".

6.  **Final Output:** [CLEANED_VALUE] ('83UJ0RZBPR') is found within the text "L-83UJ0RZBPR" which is next to "Numero pedido:" in the image.

83UJ0RZBPR value found

The first step is to find and click the thumbnail labeled 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.
Looking at the current screenshot, I see an image under "Task Responses" labeled "[88467490] - Captura una foto de 'fachada'". This is NOT the correct one. I need to find the one labeled 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de 
compra'.

I don't see the correct thumbnail or the "Live Tracking" data table yet. I need to scroll down the page to find them.

[2025-12-04 20:43:49.476 -0500] INFO: Reasoning: I have evaluated step 2. I scrolled down and now I can see the thumbnails (around y=413) and the "Live Tracking" table below it.

The task is to click the thumbnail corresponding to 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'.
In the "Live Tracking" table, I see the row 'COMPROBANTE' (y=860) has 'foto_foto' 88467491 and 'captura_foto' 88467491.
So I need to find the thumbnail associated with 88467491.
There are three thumbnails (y=413, x=375, 421, 470). The middle one and the right one look like documents/receipts.
Looking at the table row "COMPROBANTE" (y=860), the `captura_foto` is 88467491.
Looking at the table row "DOCUMENTO" (y=888), the `captura_foto` is 88467492.
The 'comprobante' is 88467491, which is likely the middle or right thumbnail. I will try clicking the middle thumbnail first (y=413, x=421), as it appears before the "DOCUMENTO" one in the table. The "COMPROBANTE" row comes before "DOCUMENTO".

Step 2 is Evidence Inspection: I need to ensure 'Numero pedido' is visible. The current image is too zoomed in. I need to zoom out using the '-' button (y=336, x=610).

The red dot shows I clicked slightly left of the minus sign. I need to click the minus sign again, aiming more for its center (y=336, x=589 or maybe x=590).

[2025-12-04 20:44:18.510 -0500] INFO: Reasoning: I have evaluated step 6. I clicked zoom out again, and the image is still the same. It seems zooming out further isn't working or it's already fully zoomed out.
I can see "FECHA ENVIO A LA DIAN: 03/12/2025 19:31:13", "COPIA MAKRO", "DATOS DEL CLIENTE", "NOMBRE:", "CEDULA:", etc., but not the "Numero pedido".

I need to scroll/pan the image *within* its viewer to find the "Numero pedido". I will try to drag the image upwards to see if the "Numero pedido" is below the current view. I'll drag from near the center (y=180, x=420) upwards to (y=50, x=420).

[2025-12-04 20:44:28.980 -0500] INFO: Reasoning: I have evaluated step 7. Dragging the image up revealed more of the lower part, showing "FIRMA" and "RAZON". It seems the "Numero pedido" is not at the top or bottom visible parts.

It's possible I clicked the wrong thumbnail initially, or the "Numero Pedido" is elsewhere.
Let's look at the "Live Tracking" table again.
For 'N├ÜMERO', the 'captura' column (y=797, x=650-700) has the value '83US1M5W9W'. This is the [RAW_VALUE].

Step 3 is complete: [RAW_VALUE] = '83US1M5W9W'.

Step 4: Data Cleaning & Normalization.
[RAW_VALUE] is '83US1M5W9W'.
A. No '--' suffix.
B. No '-' prefix.
So, [CLEANED_VALUE] = '83US1M5W9W'. It is a 10-character alphanumeric string.

Step 5: Validation Audit. I need to find '83US1M5W9W' in the loaded image, looking for "Numero pedido".
I still haven't clearly seen the "Numero pedido" field in the image. I have scrolled up (dragged image up). Maybe I need to scroll down (drag image down) or look at the other thumbnail.

The middle thumbnail (y=413, x=421) was clicked. Let's look at the rightmost one (y=413, x=470) which corresponds to "DOCUMENTO" (88467492). The task specifically asks for 'comprobante' (88467491), which I believe I clicked.  

Let me try to drag the image down to see if the "Numero pedido" was above. Drag from (y=100, x=420) to (y=250, x=420).

[2025-12-04 20:44:38.532 -0500] INFO: Reasoning: I have evaluated step 8. Dragging down showed the top part again. I still do not see "Numero pedido" or the value '83US1M5W9W' anywhere in the currently visible part of the image.

The image seems to be a receipt or invoice, but I've scanned the top and bottom portions revealed so far and haven't found the order number.

Maybe the "Numero pedido" is in the *other* document/image. The task says "click the thumbnail that is labeled with or corresponds to the Evidence Key: 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra'". In the table, 'COMPROBANTE' corresponds to 88467491, which is the middle thumbnail I clicked (y=413, x=421). The rightmost one (y=413, x=470) is 'DOCUMENTO' (88467492).

It is possible that the 'Numero pedido' is NOT in the 'comprobante' image, but maybe in the 'DOCUMENTO' one, even though the instruction was to click 'comprobante'. However, the value '83US1M5W9W' was extracted from the 'N├ÜMERO' row, which is separate from 'COMPROBANTE' and 'DOCUMENTO'.

Let's re-examine the 'comprobante' image very carefully. I will try to drag it left and right to see if it's wider.
Drag from (y=180, x=420) to (y=180, x=300) - drag left.

--- Task 4 Audit Result ---
Validation Status: I have evaluated step 9. Dragging left didn't reveal anything new on the left side of the document.

The [CLEANED_VALUE] is '83US1M5W9W'. I am looking for this string or "Numero pedido" containing this string within the image displayed. I have scrolled up, down, and left, and zoomed out, but I cannot see this value or "Numero pedido" in the current image (which is 88467491 - Comprobante).

Maybe the 'NÚMERO' 'captura' value '83US1M5W9W' is *itself* the "Numero pedido" and should be visible as such, but it isn't.

Given that I have thoroughly inspected the image corresponding to 'comprobante' (88467491) by zooming and panning, and I cannot find the [CLEANED_VALUE] '83US1M5W9W' within it, nor a field explicitly labeled "Numero pedido" containing it, I have to conclude it's not present in *this* evidence.

The instruction was very specific to click the thumbnail corresponding to 'Captura una foto del 'comprobante' de compra', which I did, and it loaded image 88467491. I have inspected this image.

Therefore, based on the inspection of the 'comprobante' image, the [CLEANED_VALUE] is not found.

83US1M5W9W value not found in the evidence
